 #Menu Description
 PLANEPTUNE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Planeptune is in chaos and their CPU is fooling around. No one was prepared for the devastation caused by a war with a rebellious nation - Eden. Eventually, the rebellion was crushed but at a great price. Not learning anything from the rebellion, Neptune does nothing but being content with her status as a CPU, feasting on huge supplies of pudding and Nep Bull, and browsing N-chan; she sits in her Basilicom and plays the ruler, giving ear to people's worries and then dismissing them, as if on her own volition instead of being forced by the oracle. Risiinig discontent from the citizens as well as well as Histoire's own doubts cast a shadow over Neptune's future as a CPU. Will Planeptune be ready for the next console war, or will it collapse under the weight of its own problems?"
 
 #Character Descriptions
 POLITICS_NEPTUNE_DESC:0 "Neptune is the charismatic and friendly CPU of Planeptune. Along with being a CPU, she is famous for her love of video games and pudding... as well as a hatred for eggplants. When it comes to her rule over Planeptune, she is constantly lazying around - playing video games, eating snacks, and browsing N-chan. She is so removed from political affairs that the citizens rarely recognize her in her regular form. However, she does have a say in the politics of Planeptune, though only when Histoire forces her - usually met with quite a lot of resistance from Neptune herself. As such, Neptune is a very negligent leader, at least for now."
 POLITICS_NEPTUNE_IMPROVED_DESC:0 "Due to various circumstances that forced Neptune to act on her own instead of being pushed by Histoire, she has proven herself to be a competent and understanding leader. She enjoys her popularity with the people of Planeptune who appreciate her for her effort and leadeership skills. It even earned her a fan club, with people imitating her fashion sense and her behavior. Things are looking great for Planeptune, thanks to the CPU finally fulfilling her responsibilities."
 POLITICS_NEPGEAR_DESC:0 "Nepgear is often known as Neptune's nerdy sister who has a penchant for robots and technology. Unlike Neptune, she is more reasonable and collected - often being mistaken for being older. In contrast to Neptune's tendency to muck around, Nepgear's diligence makes her a nigh-perfect ruler of Planeptune. As Neptune has been deemed unfit to rule Planeptune, Nepgear has taken the burden on her back and will lead her people through the last war between the consoles - offering promises of great living standards and a lengthy period of peace after the war."
 POLITICS_NEPGEAR_EVIL_DESC:0 "Peace in Gamindustri has never been an option. Every nation but Planeptune needs to be eliminated in the name of peace, prosperity and progress. Coronation as the CPU of Gamindustri is imminent."
 POLITICS_HISTOIRE_DESC:0 "Histoire has has enough. No more forcing the Neps to do their bare minimum. No more controlling Planeptune from the shadows, bearing all the burden but reaping none of the awards. No more strainiing her vocal chords by reprimanding Neptune in the only way that would make her heard. A new age has come, and Planeptune has outgrown its need for a do-nothing CPU. This is the age of Histoire's rule over Planeptune. Seizing total control and working hard, Histoire will usher Planeptune into an age of prosperity and peace."
 POLITICS_PURPLE_HEART_DESC:0 "Unlike in her regular form, Purple Heart is serious, calm, and collected. A perfect leader... for the duration of her transformation. Purple Heart is gifted with prowess and skill in combat, usually hunting monsters or fighting in the frontlines. However, if the unfortunate happens and Purple Heart is defeated during a battle, a huge amount of shares will be lost."
 POLITICS_PURPLE_SISTER_DESC:0 "Just like Purple Heart, Purple Sister is skilled in combat and is often seen at the frontlines or exterminating monsters. Unlike Neptune, however, Purple Sister's personality doesn't change drastically - instead, it pretty much remains the same."
 POLITICS_BSHA_DESC:0 "It is a public secret that B-Sha is actually Presto Mask, the hero of Planeptune. After catching the most successful criminal ever - the neglectful Neptune - Presto Mask made way for B-Sha's rule. Much like Neptune, B-Sha is childish and can often  be found slacking away and being pushed by Histoire... with the added troubles of being very reluctant to fight monsters. It seems that a revolution brought little change to Planeptune in terms of its administration, except for B-Sha's promises of peace no matter the cost."

 #Ideas
 PLA_technological_powerhouse_idea:0 "Technological Powerhouse"
 PLA_technological_powerhouse_idea_desc:0 "Planeptune has always been the center of technology in Gamindustri. Towering skyscrapers and bullet trains dot the city landscape while its parks are green and its air is clear. Planeptune's technological might is something all of the other nations dream of achieving. Innovation has a name, and its name is Planeptune!"
 PLA_stagnant_birthrates_idea:0 "Stagnant Birthrates"
 PLA_stagnant_birthrates_idea_desc:0 "Technological progress doesn't come without a cost. The citizens of Planeptune are either too busy with work or too enamoured with fictional women to find a real mate. Even though Planeptune uses robots as its frontline soldiers, it puts a strain on its industry, and fresh recruits are needed for the upcoming war."
 PLA_public_unrest_dynamic_modifier:0 "Legacy of the Eden War"
 PLA_public_unrest_dynamic_modifier_desc:0 "The Eden Rebellion has scarred Planeptune's citizens deeply. Memories of brother fighting brother, landmines going off in Planeptune's beautiful nature, and windows getting broken due to gunfire are some of the few reasons why the citizens of Planeptune are not looking forward to the upcoming war with Lowee, Leanbox and Lastation."
 PLA_histoire_discontent_dynamic_modifier:0 "Imbalanced Administration"
 PLA_histoire_discontent_dynamic_modifier_desc:0 "Planeptune might seem like a stable nation, but behind the scenes Histoire does the bulk of the work while Neptune spends her days playing video games and eating pudding. This has taken a toll on Histoire's mental health, affecting how she manages the nation."
