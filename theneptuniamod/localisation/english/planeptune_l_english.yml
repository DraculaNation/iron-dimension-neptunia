 #Menu Description
 PLANEPTUNE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Planeptune is in chaos and its CPU is fooling around. No one was prepared for the devastation caused by a war with a rebellious nation - Eden. Eventually, the rebellion was crushed but at a great price. Not learning anything from the rebellion, Neptune does nothing but being content with her status as a CPU, feasting on huge supplies of pudding and Nep Bull, and browsing N-chan; she sits in her Basilicom and plays the ruler, giving ear to people's worries and then dismissing them, as if on her own volition instead of being forced by the oracle. Rising discontent from the citizens as well as well as Histoire's own doubts cast a shadow over Neptune's future as a CPU. Will Planeptune be ready for the next console war, or will it collapse under the weight of its own problems?"
 
 #Character Descriptions
 POLITICS_NEPTUNE_DESC:0 "Neptune is the charismatic and friendly CPU of Planeptune. Along with being a CPU, she is famous for her love of video games and pudding... as well as a hatred for eggplants. When it comes to her rule over Planeptune, she is constantly lazying around - playing video games, eating snacks, and browsing N-chan. She is so removed from political affairs that the citizens rarely recognize her in her regular form. However, she does have a say in the politics of Planeptune, though only when Histoire forces her - usually met with quite a lot of resistance from Neptune herself. As such, Neptune is a very negligent leader, at least for now."
 POLITICS_NEPTUNE_IMPROVED_DESC:0 "Due to various circumstances that forced Neptune to act on her own instead of being pushed by Histoire, she has proven herself to be a competent and understanding leader. She enjoys her popularity with the people of Planeptune who appreciate her for her effort and leadeership skills. It even earned her a fan club, with people imitating her fashion sense and her behavior. Things are looking great for Planeptune, thanks to the CPU finally fulfilling her responsibilities."
 POLITICS_NEPGEAR_DESC:0 "Nepgear is often known as Neptune's nerdy sister who has a penchant for robots and technology. Unlike Neptune, she is more reasonable and collected - often being mistaken for being older. In contrast to Neptune's tendency to muck around, Nepgear's diligence makes her a nigh-perfect ruler of Planeptune. As Neptune has been deemed unfit to rule Planeptune, Nepgear has taken the burden on her back and will lead her people through the last war between the consoles - offering promises of great living standards and a lengthy period of peace after the war."
 POLITICS_NEPGEAR_EVIL_DESC:0 "Peace in Gamindustri has never been an option. Every nation but Planeptune needs to be eliminated in the name of peace, prosperity and progress. Coronation as the CPU of Gamindustri is imminent."
 POLITICS_HISTOIRE_DESC:0 "Histoire has had enough. No more forcing the Neps to do their bare minimum. No more controlling Planeptune from the shadows, bearing all the burden but reaping none of the rewards. No more straining her vocal chords by reprimanding Neptune in the only way that would make her heard. A new age has come, and Planeptune has outgrown its need for a do-nothing CPU. This is the age of Histoire's rule over Planeptune. Seizing total control and working hard, Histoire will usher Planeptune into an age of prosperity and peace."
 POLITICS_PURPLE_HEART_DESC:0 "Unlike in her regular form, Purple Heart is serious, calm, and collected. A perfect leader... for the duration of her transformation. Purple Heart is gifted with prowess and skill in combat, usually hunting monsters or fighting in the frontlines. However, if the unfortunate happens and Purple Heart is defeated during a battle, a huge amount of shares will be lost."
 POLITICS_PURPLE_SISTER_DESC:0 "Just like Purple Heart, Purple Sister is skilled in combat and is often seen at the frontlines or exterminating monsters. Unlike Neptune, however, Purple Sister's personality doesn't change drastically - instead, it pretty much remains the same."
 POLITICS_BSHA_DESC:0 "It is a public secret that B-Sha is actually Presto Mask, the hero of Planeptune. After catching the worse criminal ever - the perfidious Rei Ryghts - Presto Mask seized the whole nation of Planeptune until Neptune can pay her debt. Much like Neptune, B-Sha is childish and can often  be found slacking away and being pushed by Histoire... with the added troubles of being very reluctant to fight monsters. It seems that there's little change to Planeptune in terms of its administration, except for B-Sha's promises of peace no matter the cost."

 #Minister Descriptions
 PLA_oracle_histoire_desc:0 "Histoire, Neptune's right hand and the person that bears the burden of actually administrating Planeptune. Histoire's origins are unknown, but one thing is certain - she was helping every generation of Planeptune's CPUs administrate the country. She is an incredibly old and powerful being despite what her appearance may suggest, and with her age comes wisdom - wistom that falls to Neptune and Nepgear's deaf ears. Despite her hard-working attitude, she seems to take more time than average when it comes to tasks - usually three hours for something Neptune could do in an hour. Lately, Histoire has been starting to show some cracks in her usual demeanor. She has become more demanding and assertive towards Neptune... for a reason."
 PLA_prime_minister_hatsumi_sega_desc:0 "Hatsumi Sega is a mysterious girl. She cannot remember her past and thus turned to Neptune for help. That is when Neptune noticed her willingness to help, and Hatsumi Sega quickly rose to the position of prime minister - winning the people's hearts and mind alike. Her friendly and easygoing nature gives her necessary charisma to be an iconic prime minister, but her inexperience and her amnesia prove to be a burden."
 PLA_chamberlain_compa_desc:0 "Compassion. Care. Gentleness. Altruism. Those are words many denizens of Planeptune associate with Compa, the gentle nurse who found herself climb onto the rank of Planeptune's chamberlain. Even when dealing with opponents, her attitude is gentle and friendly, always eager to understand even the villains' motivations. Therefore, Compa excels as a chamberlain, tending to the needs of the Nep sisters with incredible skill and talent. Some say that the pudding she makes tastes great!"
 PLA_intelligence_if_desc:0 "A former adventurer, IF - nicknamed Iffy, has found herself at the position of Planeptune's head of intelligence. Her dedicated nature makes her excel at carrying out orders, while her loyalty to Neptune is unquestionable. She is very light on her feet and can spot the locations of potential monster attacks easily."

 #Ideas
 PLA_technological_powerhouse_idea:0 "Technological Powerhouse"
 PLA_technological_powerhouse_idea_desc:0 "Planeptune has always been the center of technology in Gamindustri. Towering skyscrapers and bullet trains dot the city landscape while its parks are green and its air is clear. Planeptune's technological might is something all of the other nations dream of achieving. Innovation has a name, and its name is Planeptune!"
 PLA_stagnant_birthrates_idea:0 "Falling Birth Rates"
 PLA_stagnant_birthrates_idea_desc:0 "Technological progress doesn't come without a cost. The citizens of Planeptune are either too busy with work or too enamoured with fictional women to find a real mate. Even though Planeptune uses robots as its frontline soldiers, it puts a strain on its industry, and fresh recruits are needed for the upcoming war."
 PLA_public_unrest_idea:0 "Disgruntled Populace"
 PLA_public_unrest_idea_desc:0 "Outside of the city of Planeptune, it is not too uncommon to be attacked by monsters - whether by a relatively harmless dogoo or a deadly mech. With Planeptune's guards underequipped and inexperienced, monster attacks are sadly an everyday occurence in Planeptune due to its capital's proximity to the Gamindustri Graveyard.\nIn a time of need, the people of Planeptune feel abandoned by their goddess, whom they haven't seen for years. If no action is taken, the people might take matters into their own hands. Will Lady Purple Heart be able to win back her people? Or will Planeptune fall to chaos?"
 PLA_histoire_discontent_idea:0 "Imbalanced Administration"
 PLA_histoire_discontent_idea_desc:0 "Planeptune might seem like a stable nation, but behind the scenes Histoire does the bulk of the work while Neptune spends her days playing video games and lazying around. Cracks have begun to show in Histoire's usually flawless ways of handling situation, and outbursts are getting more common. Planeptune's stability depends on Histoire's state of mind - if something goes wrong with her, Planeptune will become an anarchy masquerading as a nation with a CPU."
 PLA_public_unrest_dummy_idea:0 "Disgruntled Populace"
 PLA_public_unrest_dummy_idea_desc:0 "Outside of the city of Planeptune, it is not too uncommon to be attacked by monsters - whether by a relatively harmless dogoo or a deadly mech.

In order to make up for Neptune's lack of work, Histoire takes care of important tasks.

 planeptune.1.t:0 "A Day in the Life of Nep"
 planeptune.1.d:0 "''Why do you have to always choose cheap characters, sis? Can't you choose a fun character this time?'' Neptune whined as her sister giggled. ''You're just a scrub who doesn't want to lose! Come on, let me choose a character for you!'' Neptune tried to grab Nepgear's joystick, forcing both of the sisters out of the comfortable sitting position. Just as Neptune was about to reach the joystick, Nepgear gently yanked the cable, disconnecting it from the console. She got up and started running, with Neptune soon following after. ''You're telling me I can't handle losing? Just look at yourself!'' Nepgear said in between her chuckles. Suddenly, the cord conveniently tangled around Nepgear's legs and she fell down, causing Neptune to also trip over her.\n\n''If only you would put as much effort into being a goddess as you do being angry at video games,'' Histoire's airy voice resonated throughout Neptune's thick skull as she raised her head. Instead of feeling remorse, Neptune only felt frustration. ''Damn it Histy! You ruined a sisterly moment. I need to show the player that I'm the protagonist, and that Nepgear is my sweet but shy sister!'' Neptune groaned, scratching the back of her head as she looked at Histoire. ''Enough meta comments. There has been a monster attack in Erethisan that might need--'' ''Can't you send Falcom again?'' Neptune interrupted, causing Histoire to display a mean grimace. ''Take a look at yourself, Neptune! Our shares have been in a decline for a long time now and I know who's responsible!'' Histoire tried to emit a piercing gaze into Neptune as she looked to the side. ''I'm telling you, Histy, I told B-sha not to extort money from people, but I guess--'' ''Enough of this, Neptune!'' Histoire snapped. A few pages have materialized in her arms. ''You will start immediately! Reading a couple of pages is the least of your worries. After this, you will hear what the people of LAN Castle have to say about the recent invasion of Horsebirds.''"
 planeptune.1.a:0 "''Seriously, Histy?'' Neptune groaned."
 
 planeptune.2.t:0 "An Invitation from Neptune"
 planeptune.2.d:0 "Today, a sealed message has come from Planeptune, addressed to [Root.GetLeader]. The message contained an invitation to sign the Friendship Treaty. The latest ceasefire limited the four nations' military capabilities to ensure stability. The next step would be to prohibit the use of military force to obtain Shares or achieve other goals, which will be included in the aforementioned treaty.\nIf we want to make the Gamindustri a better place and win the hearts and minds of our citizens, signing the Friendship treaty is an obligation, no matter our stance on Planeptune or the other nations!"
 planeptune.2.a:0 "We're off to Planeptune!"
 
 planeptune.3.t:0 "The Friendship Treaty begins!"
 planeptune.3.d:0 "After agreeing to meet up today, Neptune and the other goddesses - Vert, Blanc and Noire, have gathered in Planeptune despite their differences and their long histories of conflict between each other. Today, we shall not look at the citizens of Lowee, Leanbox and Lastation as enemies, but as brothers- and sisters-in-arms. We shall not fight over petty things like shares or territory - in the end, we shall find a way to produce shares instead of taking them away from other nations. Gamindustri shall not be a place of war, but a place of friendly competition. No one has to die - not for Planeptune, not for Leanbox, not for Lowee, not for Lastation.\nBefore the Friendship Treaty is signed, we will have a massive celebration as each of the four goddesses will address the citizens of Gamindustri. Only the finest ensembles will grace our ears with splendid music, and only the finest wine will treat our taste buds. Let the celebration begin!"
 planeptune.3.a:0 "For Gamindustri!"
 
 planeptune.4.t:0 "Frustrations of a Cold Goddess"
 planeptune.4.d:0 "The goddesses were all standing on the Basilicom's extravagant purple balcony, adorned by tables made of rich mahogany. The CPU candidates were inside of the Basilicom, sharing nonspecific wisdom between each other, enjoying life, and playing games. Purple Heart looked up to the sky, breathing in Planeptune's fresh air. Neptune's HDD form certainly was a much better conversationalist. ''With the Friendship Treaty, we will all have a reason to celebrate. Planeptune will help other nations develop better, cleaner technology.'' As she said ‘cleaner', she gave Black Heart a glance. She interpreted this as a critique.\n\n''I would usually respond in a hostile manner, but I do have to admit. Lastation has been lacking in developing a clean, ecological industry. It... might be time for us to move on and clean Lastation of pollution.'' Looking at the floor, the goddesses could feel that Black Heart was honest about Lastation's shortcomings. Lifting her upper lip a little in surprise, Purple Heart added: ''I wasn't expecting you to be so serious about this. This treaty... it might work.''\n\n''Planeptune has been facing stagnation in many areas. Our shares have been dropping, and it has been my fault. I have failed everyone - my people, my faithful oracle Histoire, and even you,'' Purple Heart spoke in a soft tone. ''After the Friendship Treaty, this will change. Planeptune will become what it once was.'' Purple Heart then gave White Heart a glance. She nodded.\n\n''Lowee has been a hot mess lately. Various political factions, lack of industrialization, yadda yadda yadda… it's not ideal. Hell, I don't know what's causing it. It's making me angry, but I don't want to react in blind rage. I want to cooperate with all of you.'' White Heart gave a small smile, enough to rouse hope in the hearts of other goddesses. ''I will also work on myself. I've been getting really angry--''\n\n''Well, maybe food from Leanbox can help you with what you're lacking,'' Green Heart said with a sarcastic smirk, putting her palm below her mouth as she silently giggled to herself. ''What did you just say?'' White Heart answered, eyes wide open and alert - giving Green Heart a mean look. ''Oh, nothing. Carry on,'' Green Heart answered, hoping that White Heart would forget her snide remark. How wrong she was...\n\n''Are you saying that I'm flat?!'' White Heart exploded. The two observing goddesses gasped. ''Well no, but I'm not denying it either,'' Green Heart smugly flaunted. ''How about I buy you a burger lat--'' ''Shut up! I'm not flat! I've had it with you and your provocations, you respectless, uncouth bitch!'' White Heart shouted, interrupting Green Heart.\n\nWhat followed was a huge fight between the two goddesses. Purple Heart and Black Heart, trying to calm both of them down, got dragged into the fight. At the end, the rest of the goddesses flew to their nations, while Neptune was left alone. The Friendship Treaty was null and void."
 planeptune.4.a:0 "If the goddesses just want to bicker about breast size, the treaty is meaningless!"
 planeptune.4.b:0 "Blanc is not flat and does NOT look like a little girl!!!"
 
 planeptune.5.t:0 "Catching some Zs..."
 planeptune.5.d:0 "Neptune was in her room. Tomorrow was the Friendship Treaty which she is supposed to spearhead. ‘Setting the tables and preparing the celebration is so lame,' she thought. The ceiling in her bedroom was quite plain. Histoire made it like that on purpose - plain, lame, generic... Neptune finally felt a smidge of tiredness. She closed her eyes, but doing so only seemed to wake her up even more. What was Nepgear up to? Last time they talked, she was working on a gundam. No, that's not boring enough. Close your eyes, Neptune! Try to sleep!\n\nNeptune heard a knock. ''Uuugh… I'm coming,'' she said as she groggily walked over to the door. ''Histy, if you're bugging--'' the door opened, and Lowee's CPU candidates playfully rushed in. ''Sleepover!'' they chanted, grabbing one of Neptune's pillows and hitting each other with it. Before Neptune could shout at them, she felt a hand on her shoulder. ''Hey,'' a calm and familiar voice said, ''I couldn't sleep knowing that our struggle will end tomorrow so I thought we could visit you now.'' Neptune smiled. She wasn't tired anymore - she decided she's gonna pull an all-nighter with Blanc and her sisters! She quickly called Nepgear who joined in on the fun! Is this what it feels like to have an ally?\n\nAs Neptune and Blanc were enjoying Rom and Ram's tea party, they suddenly heard a loud frustrated groan. As their eyes darted to the door, they saw Noire and Uni. ''I didn't know Blanc would be here too. Well, whatever, it's not too late to have fun!'' Noire shrugged, smiling as she walked towards the group. Soon enough, Vert joined in on the fun too - as she finished a raid early and couldn't sleep either. They all had an amazing all-nighter! Finally, war would be a thing of the past in Gamindustri. As she dreamed of this amazing all-nighter, Neptune started snoring as she drooled on the pillow.\n\nFlying over to the Planeptune Basilicom, Black Heart and Black Sister were the first to come. Black Heart looked around - there were no signs of Neptune. The ceremony didn't even start. This was obviously a provocation! Neptune singled her out so she could ambush her. Gently nudging her sister and whispering ''Let's go home,'' Black Heart flew back to Lastation.\n\nThen came White Heart and her sisters. They were alone, vulnerable in Planeptune's airspace. It was a dirty trick! Purple Heart wanted to ambush her and her sisters. A fighter jet could be arriving any minute, aiming to attack her! ''Neptune you bitch!'' Blanc shouted as she nodded to her sisters that they should retreat. The White Sisters frowned, flying back to Lowee with White Heart.\n\nAfter Neptune woke up, she realized she overslept - she quickly rushed outside. Green Heart was flying towards the Basilicom. ''Wait, where are the others?'' Neptune asked. Green Heart chuckled. ''I was involved in a raid so I came late. Looks like you're even more late than me!'' Neptune scratched her head before it sank in. Watching Green Heart fly away, Neptune shed a tear. Her own incompetence was her undoing... again."
 planeptune.5.a:0 "A Friendship Treaty is void if it's heaeded by someone as inept as Neptune!"
 planeptune.5.b:0 "Oopsies..."
 
 planeptune.6.t:0 "What Loneliness Does to You! (Vol 1) (Limited Edition!)"
 planeptune.6.d:0 "The goddesses were on the Planeptune Basilicom's spacious balcony. As she looked at the setting sun, Purple Heart solemnly smiled. The Console Wars were over. Planeptune will be able to restore its former glory without the fear of being trampled upon by other nations. Black Heart was standing by her side, looking down on the huge ceremony. With the help of the other nations, Black Heart's rule will finally become entrenched. Inside the Basilicom, White Heart was looking out of the window. The people of Lowee will know joy once the borders become demilitarized. They will make friends with visitors from Planeptune, Lastation, and Leanbox.\n\nIn another corner of the Basilicom, Green Heart was sitting on a table, observing the CPU candidates talking and having fun with each other. What she'd give for a sister. Neptune and Noire are so lucky, not to mention Blanc. Green Heart transformed back into Vert. If she could only have a sister...\n\n''Hey, Nepgear. We've been developing a small gadget for every citizen of Leanbox. It's called the Red Ring. Would you like to see the prototype?'' Vert called out. After cheerfully announcing that she would come and see, Nepgear happily bounced over to Vert. ''Come closer, you gotta see all the details!''\n\nAs Nepgear came closer, Vert suddenly enveloped her with her arms, not letting go at any cost. Smushed against Vert's huge breasts, Nepgear began flailing her arms and procuring muffled screams. ''Leff me goooo!'' she cried out. Vert started running towards the balcony, transforming back into Green Heart. Nepgear cried out again: ''I'm shuffocating! Shtooop!''\n\nAs her sister's voice reached over to her, Purple Heart flew over Green Heart. ''Give me back my sister! Now!'' Purple Heart shouted in vain. Green Heart continued to fly towards Leanbox. What came next was a fight between the two goddesses. Nepgear almost fell down to her death if it were not for Black Heart.\n\nSoon enough, Green Heart retreated to Leanbox. Sporting a forlorn grimace, Purple Heart landed among the other goddesses. White Heart took two steps forward. ''You know what? All of you keep doing dumb shit no matter what! This treaty means nothing! I'm out!'' she said as she demonstratively left, flying to the cold northern nation of Lowee. Purple Heart then looked at Black Heart. Much to her dismay, Black Heart shook her head and flew back to Lastation with her sister. The Friendship Treaty was a complete failure."
 planeptune.6.a:0 "If such hostile acts would have continued, the treaty would have been meaningless!"
 planeptune.6.b:0 "Vert deserves a sister..."
 
 planeptune.7.t:0 "The Melancholy of Black Heart"
 planeptune.7.d:0 "It was an unusual morning for Noire. This time, it was she who woke up before Uni. Even though she still sported her trademark stoic expression, she was elated - and it was easy to see thanks to her eagerness. Darting over to her wardrobe, she looked at the clothes she could wear. She wanted to choose clothes both for her regular form and her HDD form. After deciding on a dress that would accentuate her HDD form's figure, she immediately went to wake Uni up. Uni knew what she had to do. In a jiffy, both of the Lastation sisters flew westwards - towards Planeptune, where history is going to be made.\n\nNoire came to the ceremony early. Neptune wasn't even in her HDD form yet, as Noire has caught her off guard. ''Sheesh, Noire, why did you have to come so early?'' Neptune said, frustrated and disappointed that she'll have to prepare the celebration earlier than she thought. As she transformed into her CPU form, the frustration caused by Noire was still present in the back of her mind. She wasn't going to let this go so easily. As she prepared everything at the last minute before the other goddesses and candidates arrived, the celebration officially started.\n\n''Does this mean we're going to cooperate? Because I don't mind Nepgear being the official ambassador to Leanbox,'' Green Heart said. ''I think we should visit each other regardless. This is a friendship treaty, not a cooperation treaty, right?'' Black Heart chimed in. There was a spark of enthusiasm in her otherwise emotionless tone. Purple Heart looked at her, smiling with the corner of her mouth. She knew what to say to push Black Heart's buttons. ''Seems like you're desperate for friends.'' As she heard Purple Heart utter this, Black Heart went into a shock. Eyes wide open, mouth agape. Rage was building inside of her - quickly but still able to be felt as it rose. Black Heart furrowed her brows, her gaze pointed towards Purple Heart.\n\nThat night, Neptune groaned as she and Nepgear cleaned the messy balcony - tables thrown everywhere, broken plates lying on the ground, small puddles of wine splotched across the floor. ''Why can't Histy take care of this?'' Neptune complained. She looked behind her shoulders, seeing Histoire gaze back at her. ''It is your own doing. Besides, I would have this place cleaned in three hours while you and Nepgear can do it in an hour.'' Neptune didn't say anything, silently conceding to Histoire's arguments. After all, the Friendship Treaty turned out to be a failure."
 planeptune.7.a:0 "You can't be friends with petty people."
 planeptune.7.b:0 "Noire has no friends?! What a load of NepBull!"
 
 planeptune.8.t:0 "In a Pissty Morning"
 planeptune.8.d:0 "''And now we come to the part of the story where our beloved heroine is trapped in the middle of a tragic misunderstanding that will be conveniently solved by the end of the game,'' Neptune said to no one in particular. ''Are you capable of taking anything seriously? Can you imagine how much work I'll have to do to undo this mess?'' Histoire fumed. ''Uh oh, Pissty's coming out.'' Neptune bemoaned. ''This isn't a game!'' Histoire raised her voice in what barely counted as a yell. ''Really? We're going with that cliche? Saying it's not a game in these circumstances?'' Neptune sighed in return.\n\n''I have no idea why I continue this position,'' Histoire sighed with a hint of aggression. ''That's your job obviously, you're supposed to do this. Speaking of which, I could use some pudding.'' Neptune said, blissfully unaware of the weight of her words. ''Neptune! You are so insensitive!'' Histoire glared. Immediately answering Histoire, Neptune furrowed her brows and raised her voice: ''What's really insensitive is ignoring my need for pudding. I'm starving to death over here.'' Histoire stayed silent with a faintly noticeable look of anger in her eyes and stormed off."
 planeptune.8.a:0 "But what about the pudding?"
 
 planeptune.9.t:0 "Why Die for Planeptune?"
 
 planeptune.10.t:0 "UNUSED EVENT"
 planeptune.10.d:0 "There was supposed to be yet another event after the friendship treaty fails. The first one was supposed to be just Neptune realizing the consequences of the Friendship Treaty failing, while this event was supposed to depict Neptune taking a depression nap and then being yelled at by Histoire, which would make her angrier."
 planeptune.10.a:0 "Huh. Cool."
 
 planeptune.11.t:0 "Breaking the Virtua Treaty"
 planeptune.11.d:0 "It was clear that tensions will continue to rise between the four nations. Both Histoire and Neptune watched the internal politics of the other three nations with bated breath. It was clear that Planeptune would need to kickstart army recruitment soon, despite the falling birth rates. Histoire kept thinking. What if Planeptune was to break the Virtua treaty and remilitarize the island of Erethisan? One look at Neptune's naive eyes and she could see that she was thinking the same thing inside her thick skull. Just to be sure, she asked:\n\n''Are you also thinking of remilitarizing Erethisan?'' Neptune looked up, leaning her index finger against her lips, as if in deep thought. ''Yes, but I was thinking of how we're gonna do it. Got any ideas? If we do it too quickly our citizens might get mad,'' Neptune gave her two cents. Histoire thought for three seconds. ''If we do it quickly, the other nations won't be able to react to it,'' she said. ''I'd very much prefer it if we do it quickly rather than prolong the inevitable,'' she continued. ''But Histy, the other nations aren't gonna do s--'' ''I'm sure nothing will go wrong if we do it quickly,'' Histoire quickly interjected. ''Wow, what is this? Some family friendly show where I can't say sh--'' ''Not now, Neptune!'' Histoire interjected again. Frustration could be once again heard in her voice. ''You're the CPU, so the choice is yours. Remilitarize quickly, or do it gradually?''"
 planeptune.11.a:0 "''Alright Histy, let's do it your way - remilitarization ASAP!''"
 planeptune.11.b:0 "''Umm I think the people are mad enough as it is, Histy.''"
 
 planeptune.12.t:0 "Neptune reaches her boiling point!"
 planeptune.12.d:0 "After feasting on lots of pudding during her gaming all-nighter, Neptune was napping with a full belly - hunger sated and her need for fun satisfied. As sugary drool was flowing down her cheek and a bubble of snot beginning to form on one of her nostrils, she groggily opened her eyes to Histoire's harsh but airy voice. ''Neptune! Look at you! We have an important task at hand and you're napping!'' Histoire critiqued her, emitting a piercing gaze. This made Neptune incredibly uncomfortable. ''Uh, Pissty, you know I'm not in the mood for--'' ''Don't you ‘Pissty' me!'' Histoire shouted. Neptune rarely saw her like that. ''Now, come along and do what needs to be done! Your people are waiting for you!'' Histoire said, turning her back on Neptune and levitating towards her office.\n\nNeptune had a really sour taste in her mouth. She knew that she was supposed to be doing administrative tasks, but Histoire is soooooo annoying! Rising from her comfy, cushioned sofa. Neptune thought of what she'd do. Maybe she'll tell Histoire how annoying she can be while still obeying her? Maybe she'll stay silent and do the task half-heartedly under Histoire's supervision? Maybe she'd punish her by ignoring her and leaving the task up to her? Think quick, Neptune! The choice is yours!"
 planeptune.12.a:0 "Do it half-heartedly"
 planeptune.12.b:0 "Let Histoire do the task"
 planeptune.12.c:0 "Do the task but lash out on Histoire"
 
 planeptune.13.t:0 "Erethisan is remilitarized!"
 planeptune.13.d:0 "Neptune's efforts have paid off! She managed to remilitarize Erethisan without too much public outcry. After faking a huge monster attack on Erethisan, the people of the aforementioned island have decided to take up arms and allow Planeptune's army back into the formerly demilitarized zones! As Planeptune's rifles are raised in Erethisan again, Neptune can do nothing but smile gladly at her decision. She made the right call."
 planeptune.13.a:0 "Now no one can tread on Erethisan!"
 
 planeptune.36.t:0 "A Planeptune Delegate Arrives"
 planeptune.36.d:0 "After hosting the atrocity formerly known as the ‘Friendship Treaty', Planeptune's administration has gathered enough courage to send a delegate to us. The delegate wanted to discuss the topic of a joint invasion on Gamindustri Graveyard, a move which they deem very profitable - both for our economy and the safety of our people. Since they have proposed an amazing offer that works for us, we have no option but to accept this offer.\n\nAfter occupying Gamindustri Graveyard, we will set up a puppet government headed by Ganache - a man with incredible administrative skills. He will lead a company which would sell Gamindustri Graveyard's resources for cheap to nations that approve of this joint invasion."
 planeptune.36.a:0 "Splendid!"
 
 planeptune.37.t:0 "A Byzantine Power Game?"
 planeptune.37.d:0 "Since Northern Westwind Ravine is closer to us rather than to Planeptune, we have taken the matter of contacting Lowee into our own hands. We have two options. The first one would be to concede Northern Westwind Ravine to Lowee after the occupation. Even though the territory is worthless in terms of its minuscule population and lack of resources, it would nonetheless satisfy Blanc's megalomania.\n\nOn the other hand, we can promise nothing to Lowee, which would in turn guarantee a diplomatic protest from Blanc and in turn harm Planeptune's efforts of starting the invasion. Should we be honorable and make necessary concessions to Lowee, or should we be more subversive?"
 planeptune.37.a:0 "Tell Lowee that we'll give them Northern Westwind Ravine"
 planeptune.37.b:0 "We'll promise nothing"
 
 planeptune.38.t:0 "Lastation and Planeptune Delegates Arrive"
 planeptune.38.d:0 "Recently, Lastation and Planeptune have been planning a joint invasion on Gamindustri Graveyard. During their talks, one of the nations recommended that they concede Northern Westwind Ravine to us. Since we will not be involved in the war, it would be wise to accept the territory and the trade deal. Otherwise, if we want, we can issue a diplomatic protest that would harm the results of the invasion."
 planeptune.38.a:0 "Give them our support!"
 planeptune.38.b:0 "That territory is worthless! Boycott the invasion!"
 
 planeptune.39.t:0 "Lastation and Planeptune Delegates Arrive"
 planeptune.39.d:0 "Today, scandalous news came out of our Planeptune and Lastation embassies. The delegates have announced a joint invasion of Gamindustri Graveyard! Even though Lowee shares a small border with the territory, both Planeptune and Lastation decided not to include us in their plans - not even offering us a piece of territory. This warrants a diplomatic protest!"
 planeptune.39.a:0 "Boycott the invasion!"
 
 planeptune.40.t:0 "Planeptune and Lastation Announce Their Ambitions"
 planeptune.40.d:0 "Today, we received two emails from the Planeptune and Lastation administrations. The emails entail a planned invasion that the two nations plan to realize in the future. In the email, both of the nations ask for Leanbox's approval. If we approve, we will be able to trade with the company running the occupation zone. However, if we decline, we will be unable to trade with them, but we will also hurt their economy. What shall we do?"
 planeptune.40.a:0 "This seems fine by us!"
 planeptune.40.b:0 "Trade isn't worth it; issue a diplomatic protest!"
 
 planeptune.41.t:0 "Neptune Wake Up"
 planeptune.41.d:0 "Neptune was sick of binging on pudding… at least for the day. Each bite felt like a sting, and each sugary high was met by an even stronger crash. Even though she wanted to stop, she kept indulging in it even further. For one moment however, she seemed to snap out of it - she was aware of her grip and how strong it was. Neptune threw the pudding against the wall. A yellow-brown splotch covered the wall as the plastic waste fell to the floor. ‘I'm sick of this!' Neptune thought to herself, making a grimace as if she was saying it.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to the people of Planeptune. She lifted her brows and opened her mouth. Was this what their goddess was? A pudding junkie who doesn't leave the basilicom for days? Someone who'd rather play games than tend to her people's needs? This sudden pang of empathy was incredibly uncomfortable for Neptune. But even more importantly, it was sobering. She knew that these fleeting pleasures won't last very long and that she had to do something.\n\nShe thought of how she could help the people. Putting her index finger on her lower lip, she finally managed to get her brain running. Since she wasn't the best at understanding people, she started thinking of what she liked. Pudding! What if Neptune were to share her love for pudding with the people? Maybe make a state-subsidized company or her own brand of pudding? What if she would prove to the people and herself that she doesn't lack self control and go easy on the pudding?\n\nAn image of Histoire popped into her mind. She would always tell Neptune not to overindulge on pudding and games. Were there any other ways to make Histoire happy? She kept thinking - even empty platitudes were enough for Histoire to react positively. No, no, that doesn't require much effort. She needed to do something that counts. What does Histoire like? Ummm, Planeptune? Maybe she could show dedication to her role which would make Histoire happy? What of the birth rates? Neptune felt like smoke was fuming out of her ears. Her brain went into overdrive.\n\nShe stopped thinking. Phew! Too many complex thoughts, at least for Neptune's standards. She jumped on the bed to rest for a few seconds. She looked at the pudding splotch on the wall. Its texture, its smell, its shape - it still looked tasty. Neptune stood up. ‘I need some pudding,' she thought as she started walking to the kitchen."

 planeptune.42.t:0 "Beach Episode!"
 planeptune.42.d:0 "It seems to be an unnaturally calm day for Powerlevel Resort. Even though the sun was shining and the water was calm, there were no beachgoers. Though the day was beautiful, it seemed to be wasted. People were busy with other things, considering the current political turmoil caused by the failed treaty. All of a sudden, a huge group of people was running towards the beach. Hundreds of bikini-clad girls with toned bodies were nearing themselves to the water.\n\nIn a moment, the beach went from abandoned and forgotten to swarming with people. In one corner, a jovial blue-haired girl loaded her water gun, spraying her comrade-in-arms in the face. In another corner, several girls laid down, tanning themselves without a care in the world. Another group of friends was enjoying swimming. ''Hey guys, wanna see if I can swim over to Leanbox?'' joked the tanned spiky-haired tomboy. ''Come on, if I swim the furthest, the ice cream is on Shimizu-chan!'' As she said that, the chubbier-looking girl in her group sighed.\n\nBack on the beach, Nepgear and B-Sha were playing volleyball. B-Sha's brows were furrowed as she grinned from ear to ear. Nepgear was sweating and panting in exhaustion. ''B-Sha, you know I'm not that good at volleyball. Go easy on me!'' she said, barely able to use her voice. ''But I am going easy on you!'' B-Sha chuckled, flaunting her volleyball skills. Nepgear ignored her and made a solid serve. As the ball flew into the air, B-Sha quickly jumped, slamming the ball down with her palm. With the ball hitting the soft sand underneath and making a mark, Nepgear whined. ''This isn't fun anymore, B-Sha!''\n\nB-Sha started laughing. ''I won!'' She gloated, rolling carelessly on the sand. Who knew that such a girl would become Planeptune's number one field marshal? ''I won, I won, I won, I won!'' she continued, not paying any attention to Nepgear. ''Hey B-Sha, catch!'' Nepgear shouted. As B-Sha stood up, she turned her head just in time to be hit by a packet of ice cream. Nepgear giggled as she opened her packet, taking out a popsicle. B-Sha still sported a smile. ''You're the best, Nepgear! This is the most fun I've had in a while!'' B-Sha thanked her. ''Me and the army are… really enjoying this,'' she said as giggles coming from the beach only made it more apparent. Nepgear smiled warmly."
 planeptune.42.a:0 "''Let's have a water gun fight when you finish your ice cream, okay?''"
 
 planeptune.43.t:0 "Commander Nepgear"
 planeptune.43.d:0 "Near LAN Castle, the barracks were bustling. One could hear continuous marching as the army was quickly mobilized. ''Attention, attention! Lowee has attacked us! Get your guns and show them who's the boss! Woooo!'' B-Sha shouted through the loudspeakers. Every single one of Planeptune's soldiers had a determined, stern expression. ‘Lowee is attacking? Bullshit!' One of them thought. The fact that it was a simple drill orchestrated by Nepgear was apparent.\n\nAs the soldiers stood in rows, the humid air from the LAN Lake engulfed them. On the other side were cardboard cutouts of Lowee soldiers. One of Planeptune's soldiers tried not to giggle, putting her hand on her mouth as her eyes betrayed her otherwise stoic expression. ''We couldn't capture any real Lowee soldiers so I guess cardboard cutouts would have to do,'' Nepgear half-jokingly said in her trademark tone. She stepped on the polygon in a redundantly purple camo outfit, hands behind her back. ''Today we are going to practice defense on open terrain.''\n\nNepgear proved to be a very capable commander. There was something inside of her which radiated the feeling of authority. Even though such an important exercise was carried out with no prior warning, the soldiers did their best. The cardboard cutouts were toast, left to be cleaned by an unlucky janitor. As the sun was beginning to set, Nepgear bid the soldiers farewell and went back to Planeptune's Basilicom, flying with the help of her HDD form.\n\n''The drill went well,'' Nepgear told Histoire. ''No one complained. They all listened to me,'' she continued as a smile formed on her face. This caused Histoire to smile back. ''I'm glad you have engaged yourself in commanding Planeptune's forces. I think we are better prepared for when worse times come,'' Histoire solemnly said. ''I watched the training footage, you are certainly gifted in commanding them.'' Nepgear was elated. ''Thank you, Histoire,'' she said as she bowed in respect.\n\nThe next day, someone knocked at the Basilicom's door. As Nepgear opened it, she found Falcom standing on the other side. ''I loved the training video montage you sent me. You know, it made me wanna become a general,'' she said as Nepgear motioned her to come inside. In a few days, Falcom received the necessary training to be able to command Planeptune's troops. Overall, the emergency drills were a huge success."
